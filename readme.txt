An extremely fast and easy to use plugin which allows you to embed videos into WordPress blogs. Both Flash and HTML5 modes are supported.

== Description ==

The KVS Player plugin (developed by [CyberSEO.net](http://www.cyberseo.net/ "CyberSEO.net")) allows you to embed FLV, F4V and MP4 videos into WordPress posts and pages using the following shortcode:

`[flv:url image width height link player]`

where:

* url - URL of the video file you want to embed;

* width (optional) - width of the video;
* height (optional) - height of the video;
* link (optional) - URL to the external page the display, control bar and playlist can link to (default: #);
